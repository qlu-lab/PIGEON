# PIGEON
`PIGEON` (**P**olygen**I**c **G**ene-**E**nvironment interacti**ON**) is a Python3-based command line tool for estimating polygenic gene-environment (GxE) interactions using GWIS (and GWAS) summary statistics.

The `PIGEON` software can be used to
1. estimate the GxE variance components (proportion of phenotypic variance explained by genome-wide GxE interactions).
2. perform hypothesis-free scans for PGSxE across many PGS (without the need to calculate PGS).

## Manual

`PIGEON` can be downloaded via `git clone https://github.com/qlu-lab/PIGEON`

Please see the [wiki](https://github.com/qlu-lab/PIGEON/wiki) for the short tutorials describing the two basic functions (estimating GxE variance components and hypothesis-free scans for PGSxE), as well as the detailed manual of `PIGEON`. 

Please see the [FAQ](https://github.com/qlu-lab/PIGEON/wiki/FAQ) for the commonly asked question regrading `PIGEON`.
